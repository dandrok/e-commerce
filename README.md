# e-commerce

E-commerce SPA.

Due to the fact that the UI turned out to be quite detailed and I tried to focus on responsiveness.
I ran out of time to do the functionality and finish the rest of the site. I was able to do almost the entire product page and started styling the cart page.

We have the possibility to enter the basket and return to the product page.

- REACT
- hooks
- react router
- css module

`two days is definitely not enough for me to do this task - including styling everything with css`

```
npm install
npm start
```
